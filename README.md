# beauty-consumer-behavior-analysis
Analysis of global beauty consumer survey data using Python to uncover behavioral trends, confidence patterns, and demographic insights.

**Project Objective**

To understand what drives beauty-related behaviors across different populations, including:

How often people use beauty products

What personal factors influence beauty routines

Whether regions differ in attitudes toward appearance

Which demographic groups report higher or lower confidence

Potential implications for brand positioning and segmentation

The goal is to turn survey data into simple, visual, data-driven insights.

**Dataset**

The dataset contains anonymized beauty/behavior-related survey responses from multiple countries.

Key variables include:

- Frequency of beauty product use

- Self-perceived attractiveness

- Self-confidence and self-image

- Consumer motivations and routines

- Demographics (age, region, gender)

- Data cleaning included:

- Handling missing values

- Recoding categorical responses

- Extracting regional groupings

- Aggregating rating scores

**Tools & Techniques**

- Languages & Libraries

- Python

- Pandas

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Techniques

- Data cleaning & recoding

- Groupby aggregations

- Visualization (bar plots, heatmaps, line charts)

- Comparative regional analysis

- Simple trend detection and pattern storytelling

**Key Findings**
1. Regional differences in beauty product habits

Certain regions show significantly higher frequency of beauty product usage, while others show more minimal daily routines.

2. Self-confidence varies meaningfully across demographics

Younger respondents tend to report lower confidence despite higher beauty-product engagement.

3. Attitudes toward appearance show cultural patterns

Some regions emphasize natural appearance, while others emphasize grooming and beauty routines.

4. Multiple variables cluster consistently

Patterns suggest that:

Higher usage = stronger concern for appearance

Lower usage = higher natural-appearance preference

Confidence interacts with age and region

**Visualizations**

The notebook includes:

- Regional bar charts

- Confidence distribution plots

- Routine frequency heatmaps

- Attribute comparison graphs

These help stakeholders quickly understand how beauty behaviors shift across populations.

**Insights for Brands**

Brands should segment consumers by region × age × confidence levels rather than geography alone.

Emerging markets show promising growth in skincare rather than makeup usage.

Messaging that supports self-confidence resonates strongly across multiple demographics.

There is an opportunity to position products differently for “high routine” vs “low routine” groups.
